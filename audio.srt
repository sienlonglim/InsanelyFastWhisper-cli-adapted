00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,000
Data software specialist Snowflake reported earnings last night and the

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:10,640
stock is off to the races up almost 10% in pre-market trading. So what happened

3
00:00:10,640 --> 00:00:16,440
in this quarter and is this an absolutely ridiculous valuation? I mean on the face

4
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:28,480
of it trading for 252 times forwards earnings 95 times free cash flow 23 times sales by all traditional metrics you

5
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,960
should stay away from snowflake but I intend to show that not only did the

6
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:36,960
company perform excellently during the quarter but that the valuation might be

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,359
far more reasonable than you might think. My name is Brian Stofo. We'll figure all

8
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:46,840
that out over the next 10 minutes. As of the time of this recording, I do own shares of snowflake.

9
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,159
Want to give a shout out to Ycharts for sponsoring today's video.

10
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:51,560
More from them in just a minute.

11
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:53,840
So confusing calendar here.

12
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:57,240
This is snowflake's third quarter of yes, 2024.

13
00:00:57,280 --> 00:00:58,359
They have a weird calendar.

14
00:00:58,359 --> 00:01:03,399
It's going to be about a round of $62 billion company on the top line.

15
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:07,760
Revenue grew 32% to 734 million. That was ahead of Wall

16
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:12,239
Street's estimates. Management gives guidance for their product revenue. They don't worry so much

17
00:01:12,239 --> 00:01:17,920
about their service revenue and they came in well ahead of their forecast. They beat there as well

18
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:23,680
on the bottom line. Non-gap earnings per share more than doubled to 27 cents per share also ahead

19
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:25,920
of Wall Street's estimates.

20
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:27,239
When we look at margins,

21
00:01:27,239 --> 00:01:28,640
run to the nearest whole number,

22
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,239
gross margins expanded very nicely to 75%,

23
00:01:32,239 --> 00:01:35,640
operating and net margins, both expanded as well,

24
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:38,280
all on a non-gap basis.

25
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,439
Free cash flow increased from $65 million to $102 million.

26
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:44,480
Net income increased as well,

27
00:01:44,480 --> 00:01:46,640
and the balance sheet is pretty perfect

28
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:54,079
with 4.5 billion dollars in cash and investments on hand and no long term debt to speak of.

29
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:56,640
So let's look at what happened during the quarter.

30
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,120
There was some operating leverage that the company realized but not as much as it has

31
00:02:01,120 --> 00:02:02,319
in quarters past.

32
00:02:02,319 --> 00:02:05,099
We see that sales and marketing fell as a percentage

33
00:02:05,099 --> 00:02:08,360
of revenue and so did General and administrative.

34
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:12,000
However, they're spending on research and development actually expanded.

35
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,300
That doesn't bother me because this is investments in the company's future and with the advent

36
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:22,520
of AI and chat GPT, the uses for this technology are expanding.

37
00:02:22,520 --> 00:02:25,840
Now it is worth noting if you own shares of this company stock

38
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:33,680
based compensation is a very real thing. Almost $300 million during the quarter. It's about 41%

39
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,840
of revenue. That's a lot. It's worth stating that's less than it was as a percentage of revenue

40
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:46,419
in the previous quarters. But it is still a lot. and that leads to about 2.8% dilution,

41
00:02:46,419 --> 00:02:48,039
that is about the same rate of dilution

42
00:02:48,039 --> 00:02:50,960
that we were at at the same time three months ago.

43
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:53,479
Now, moving on to news for the company,

44
00:02:53,479 --> 00:02:57,919
total customers were up 24% to almost 9,000,

45
00:02:57,919 --> 00:02:59,500
and the number of customers spending

46
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:02,520
at least a million dollars grew 52%,

47
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:07,419
now 436 of them on board. Now this is important

48
00:03:07,419 --> 00:03:12,500
remaining performance obligations. It's important to just kind of review the

49
00:03:12,500 --> 00:03:16,800
way that Snowflake works. The best way that I like is it's kind of like going to

50
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:20,620
your county fair where you pay a bunch of money at a booth and you get tickets

51
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:25,039
in return and then you submit those tickets to take the ride.

52
00:03:25,039 --> 00:03:30,280
Snowflake in very crude way is very similar where companies pay a whole bunch of money

53
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,039
and then they run queries on their data.

54
00:03:33,039 --> 00:03:37,620
And when they run those queries, that's like turning in the tickets and that's when revenue

55
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:38,979
gets realized.

56
00:03:38,979 --> 00:03:44,120
But remaining performance obligations is more like keeping track of how much money has gone

57
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,620
into the booth where you get the tickets from and

58
00:03:46,620 --> 00:03:51,000
That's why it's a really important indicator now on that on that note

59
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,479
What we saw happen was remaining performance obligations is actually only up 23% less than revenue

60
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:00,000
Now part of that might be concerning

61
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:02,000
But it's worth pointing out that other

62
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:11,539
But it's worth pointing out that other usage based products like MongoDB have called out that they are willing to forgo those longer contracts and try and get customers to spend

63
00:04:11,539 --> 00:04:15,319
more moving forward by letting them just pay as they go.

64
00:04:15,319 --> 00:04:16,879
So that dynamic is there.

65
00:04:16,879 --> 00:04:20,879
And you can already see that because if you just look at the amount of remaining performance

66
00:04:20,879 --> 00:04:28,060
obligations that the company expects to realize within the next 12 months, that actually jumped 27%.

67
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,019
So something to keep your eye on.

68
00:04:30,019 --> 00:04:35,500
If there was one weak part of this, this would be it, but not a huge problem.

69
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:40,839
The company's net revenue retention rate remains best in class at 135%.

70
00:04:40,839 --> 00:04:42,000
It is coming down.

71
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:44,040
But remember what this means.

72
00:04:44,040 --> 00:04:49,120
Means that the company is not only holding on to all of its customers, but on average,

73
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,160
it's getting its customers to spend 35% more.

74
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,920
That is a fantastic dynamic.

75
00:04:56,920 --> 00:05:01,439
It's also worth pointing out that the number of customers that have at least one stable

76
00:05:01,439 --> 00:05:06,839
edge, in other words, they're sharing their data in the Snowflake marketplace is now at 28%.

77
00:05:06,839 --> 00:05:10,319
And the number of listings of those is up to 2,300.

78
00:05:10,319 --> 00:05:13,439
That's up 9% quarter on quarter.

79
00:05:13,439 --> 00:05:15,519
And I think it's worth pointing that out

80
00:05:15,519 --> 00:05:19,079
because there are high switching costs with Snowflake,

81
00:05:19,079 --> 00:05:21,199
but the use of these stable edges

82
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,959
and knowing that you can only buy data

83
00:05:23,959 --> 00:05:27,079
from other companies and sell it to other companies

84
00:05:27,079 --> 00:05:29,639
if you're on the Snowflake platform,

85
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,199
introduces another weaker but important mode

86
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,560
in the form of network effects.

87
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,279
So that is also worth watching.

88
00:05:36,279 --> 00:05:39,839
And in my opinion, very, very encouraging.

89
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:43,600
This company is a high quality company.

90
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:49,079
And it showed when the company gave its guidance for the quarter ahead that we're in right

91
00:05:49,079 --> 00:05:51,879
now, they called for 718 million.

92
00:05:51,879 --> 00:05:55,680
That might look like it's below Wall Street Testaments, but it's actually above.

93
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,680
Remember, they only talk about their product revenue.

94
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:03,600
At the midpoint, 718 million, that's 29% growth year over year.

95
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:07,000
Wall Street was expecting 26% year over year.

96
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So what should investors watch moving forward? First, that net revenue retention.

97
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,000
We want to see it remain above 120% for the next couple of quarters.

98
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:24,000
Number two, $1 million customers who want to see that number continue to grow by at least 30% for the foreseeable future.

99
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:26,139
Stable edge customers and listings

100
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,819
for that secondary network effect.

101
00:06:27,819 --> 00:06:29,220
Want to see that continue to grow?

102
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:31,220
And then check back in on that RPO.

103
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:32,579
That is an important number

104
00:06:32,579 --> 00:06:34,899
of remaining performance obligations.

105
00:06:34,899 --> 00:06:38,300
The moat is no doubt widening around this business.

106
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:41,339
The thesis is very, very much on track.

107
00:06:41,339 --> 00:06:43,699
So this is a high quality company

108
00:06:43,699 --> 00:06:45,519
that scores very well on my investing framework. So it should be no surprise So this is a high quality company that scores very well on my

109
00:06:45,519 --> 00:06:50,079
investing framework so it should be no surprise why it is a stock that I own.

110
00:06:50,079 --> 00:06:54,600
But now let's turn to valuation. Now remember for me the quality of the

111
00:06:54,600 --> 00:06:59,680
company it's anti-fragilities 80% of the equation the other 20% is valuation.

112
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:04,680
And on here I actually think that this stock might be much more affordable or

113
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:05,220
at least

114
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:08,040
not as ridiculously priced as you might think.

115
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:12,360
Now first, we've got to ask ourselves, where is it in the growth cycle?

116
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:15,800
And I would say somewhere between stages three and four.

117
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:17,879
And so there's some metrics we can look at.

118
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:19,199
And for that, we go to why charts.

119
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:22,439
It's a tool that Brian Frollini use every day.

120
00:07:22,439 --> 00:07:25,040
If you'd like to join us in using it every day, click the link

121
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:29,600
on the show notes below. Mention Brian Frodina, at least name and you'll get 20% off of your

122
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:35,759
subscription. So we head on over and we see that Snowflakes doesn't have a trailing PE ratio on a

123
00:07:35,759 --> 00:07:45,360
gap basis. On a forward basis, it's 252. Now, that might be lower than it's been at any point in the past year or two, it is still

124
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,639
a ridiculously high number.

125
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:48,879
So very expensive.

126
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,560
If we look at gross profit and add in what we saw over the previous quarter, what we see

127
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,600
is that it's trading for about 35 times gross profit.

128
00:07:58,600 --> 00:08:04,120
And if we look at free cash flows trading at about 95 times free cash flow, no matter

129
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,199
how you slice this, extremely, extremely expensive.

130
00:08:08,199 --> 00:08:11,040
This would be like a stay away from it type of stock

131
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:12,160
for many investors.

132
00:08:12,160 --> 00:08:17,120
However, we can also use a reverse discounted cashflow model

133
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:19,480
to figure out what we think of it.

134
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,779
For this tool, this is a tool that Brian Froly, Brian Withers,

135
00:08:22,779 --> 00:08:24,240
and I built ourselves.

136
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:29,360
Now, if you disagree with any input that I am putting into it for Snowflake, you can simply download

137
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,759
a copy of this absolutely free and input your own numbers. Just click the link in the show

138
00:08:33,759 --> 00:08:39,320
notes below. Here's what I'm going to do to just kind of run us through how this works.

139
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:47,120
What you first do is you put in the ticker symbol right here, SNOW. Put in trailing free cash flow, so about $632

140
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:53,759
million. I'm going to put in a terminal growth rate of 2%, a discount rate of 10%. Now, you might

141
00:08:53,759 --> 00:09:00,720
say, well, I want a market feeder, it should be 11 or 12%. You can do that. That's just getting the

142
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:06,240
market average return over the next decade. I'm saying 10%. And then we just have to

143
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:11,519
go and tell these two prices match. Now, it's worth noting that this will likely jump to about

144
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:18,240
$190 once the market opens. So I'll just change that. But now I just play with this until they match.

145
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:28,919
So 25, I'm going to have to go up to 30, 31%. So somewhere between 30 and 31% the stock has to grow.

146
00:09:28,919 --> 00:09:34,000
In order, it's free cash flow over the next 10 years in order to justify today's price.

147
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:40,159
That might seem like a lot, especially because the top line is expected to grow by 31% over

148
00:09:40,159 --> 00:09:43,759
the next few years, but keeping that up for a decade might be really hard.

149
00:09:43,759 --> 00:09:46,240
However, there's another wrinkle to add in there,

150
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,360
and that's that this company's free cash flow margin

151
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,799
or the percent of revenue that it turns into free cash flow

152
00:09:53,799 --> 00:09:55,000
is still not optimized.

153
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:59,279
And management says it should reach 30% by 2029.

154
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:04,039
So if we go back and we assume that 30% of its revenue

155
00:10:04,039 --> 00:10:06,659
is free cash flow, that changes things a little

156
00:10:06,659 --> 00:10:11,799
bit because then free cash flow would be about 800 million and then this growth rate could

157
00:10:11,799 --> 00:10:22,039
actually come down to about 28, maybe 26, somewhere around 27, depending on where the stock opens

158
00:10:22,039 --> 00:10:25,960
today. So 27%. Now, that is still a high number,

159
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:26,879
but think of it this way,

160
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,120
you have a usage-based software product in the age of AI

161
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,720
that needs to grow,

162
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:35,679
assuming it gets a 30% free cashflow margin,

163
00:10:35,679 --> 00:10:39,480
it needs to grow its revenue by about 27% per year

164
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:40,480
for 10 years.

165
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:42,399
Very high hurdle,

166
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,220
but the company is expected to grow at 31% pretty consistently over the

167
00:10:47,220 --> 00:10:48,220
next couple of years.

168
00:10:48,220 --> 00:10:54,259
And if it can do that, or it can eke out more than 30% free cash flow margin, well, then

169
00:10:54,259 --> 00:10:56,440
you've got market beating potential.

170
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,559
To me, that means that it's actually quite reasonable.

171
00:10:59,559 --> 00:11:06,240
And if I had to put it somewhere on a spectrum, I would say it lands somewhere right here. Not a screaming

172
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:11,440
by by any stretch of the imagination, but I don't think it's quite as expensive as people think.

173
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,240
And no matter what you think of the evaluation, there's no doubt that this is a very high quality

174
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,639
company. I'm sure you're going to get some people that might disagree with that valuation take.

175
00:11:20,639 --> 00:11:24,320
Probably a lot less when it comes to the company quality take, but you can let me know what you

176
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,320
think in the show notes below. and we'll check back in on

177
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:32,879
this one in 90 days. Until then, Brian, out.
